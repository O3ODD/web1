<strong><u>#</u>Let it go</strong>

<p>The snow glows white on the mountain tonight <br>
Not a footprint to be seen <br>
A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I'm the queen <br>
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside <br>
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried <br>
Don't let them in, don't let them see <br>
Be the good girl you always have to be <br>
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know <br>
Well, now they know</p>

<p>Let it go, let it go <br>
Can't hold it back anymore <br>
Let it go, let it go <br>
Turn away and slam the door <br>
I don't care what they're going to say <br>
Let the storm rage on </p>

<p>The cold never bothered me anyway <br>
It's funny how some distance <br>
makes everything seem small <br>
And the fears that once controlled me <br>
can't get to me at all <br>
It's time to see what I can do <br>
To test the limits and break through <br>
No right, no wrong, no rules for me <br>
I'm free</p>

<p>Let it go, let it go <br>
I am one with the wind and sky <br>
Let it go, let it go <br>
You'll never see me cry <br>
Here I stand and here I stay <br>
Let the storm rage on <br>
My power flurries through the air into the ground <br>
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around <br>
And one thought crystalizes like an icy blast <br>
I'm never going back <br>
The past is in the past </p>

<p>Let it go, let it go <br>
And I'll rise like the break of dawn <br>
Let it go, let it go <br>
That perfect girl is gone <br>
Here I stand in the light of day <br>
Let the storm rage on <br>
The cold never bothered me anyway</p>
