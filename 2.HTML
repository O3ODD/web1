<strong><u>#</u>Into the Unknown</strong>

<p>Ah ah oh oh oh<br>
Ah ah oh oh oh oh oh oh</p>
​
<p>I can hear you but I won't<br>
Some look for trouble while others don't<br>
There's a thousand reasons I should go about my day<br>
And ignore your whispers which I wish would go away, oh oh oh<br>
Ah ah oh oh<br>
Oh oh<br>
Ah ah oh oh</p>
​
<p>You're not a voice<br>
You're just a ringing in my ear<br>
And if I heard you, which I don't<br>
I'm spoken for I fear<br>
Everyone I've ever loved is here within these walls<br>
I'm sorry, secret siren, but I'm blocking out your calls<br>
I've had my adventure, I don't need something new<br>
I'm afraid of what I'm risking if I follow you</p>
​
<p>Into the unknown<br>
Into the unknown<br>
Into the unknown<br>
Ah ah oh oh<br>
Ah ah oh oh oh oh</p>
​
<p>What do you want? 'Cause you've been keeping me awake<br>
Are you here to distract me so I make a big mistake?<br>
Or are you someone out there who's a little bit like me?<br>
Who knows deep down I'm not where I'm meant to be?</p>
​
<p>Every day's a little harder as I feel my power grow<br>
Don't you know there's part of me that longs to go…</p>
​
<p>Into the unknown?<br>
Into the unknown<br>
Into the unknown<br>
Ah ah oh oh<br>
Ah ah oh oh</p>
​
<p>Oh oh oh
Are you out there?<br>
Do you know me?<br>
Can you feel me?<br>
Can you show me?<br>
Ah ah oh oh<br>
Ah ah oh oh<br>
Ah ah oh oh<br>
Ah ah oh oh<br>
Oh oh oh oh<br>
Oh oh oh oh<br>
Oh oh oh oh<br>
Oh oh oh oh</p>
​
<p>Where are you going?<br>
Don't leave me alone<br>
How do I follow you<br>
Into the unknown?<br>
Oh oh oh</p>
